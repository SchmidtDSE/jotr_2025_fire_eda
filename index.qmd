## About

These analyses were performed to support the post-fire reporting requirements of the National Park Service (NPS) within Joshua Tree National Park, with an emphasis on timeliness and accuracy.

Analyses help characterize burn severity, vegetation types within burned areas, and fire history to support validation of the [Fire Severity Tool](https://storage.googleapis.com/fire-recovery-web/prod/fireSeverity.html) from the [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment (DSE)](https://dse.berkeley.edu/).
